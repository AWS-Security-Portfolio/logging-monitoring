## Overview

This lab focused on implementing centralized security logging, threat detection, and configuration compliance monitoring in AWS. Using CloudTrail for API auditing, GuardDuty for threat detection, AWS Config for resource compliance, CloudWatch for alerting, and Athena for querying logs, the lab demonstrates an end-to-end logging and monitoring pipeline essential for security operations.

*A diagram of the overall process is available in the repository folder.

---

## Objectives

- Enable CloudTrail to log all API activity across regions into S3.
- Enable GuardDuty threat detection.
- Set up AWS Config with managed rules for security compliance.
- Configure CloudWatch metric filters and alarms for security events.
- Use Athena to query CloudTrail logs for audit and investigation.

---

## Steps Performed

1. CloudTrail Setup
   - Created a multi-region CloudTrail trail named main-trail.
   - Configured logs to be delivered to a dedicated S3 bucket (my-cloudtrail-logs-sebastiansilva).
   - Enabled optional CloudWatch Logs integration.
   - Verified logging via CloudTrail console and S3 bucket contents.
   - Collected sample JSON event logs for documentation.

2. GuardDuty Enablement
   - Enabled GuardDuty in the main AWS region.
   - Verified GuardDuty status via console screenshots.
   - Noted that sample findings were not generated in the environment due to AWS timing but included a sample finding JSON in documentation.

3. AWS Config Setup and Rules
   - Enabled AWS Config recording for all supported resource types.
   - Created multiple AWS managed rules focusing on security best practices, including:
      - restricted-ssh
      - s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited
      - s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited
      - ec2-instance-no-public-ip
      - iam-password-policy
      - root-account-mfa-enabled
      - cloudtrail-enabled
      - guardduty-enabled-centralized
   - Collected compliance dashboard and non-compliance example screenshots.

4. CloudWatch Metric Filter & Alarm
   - Created a metric filter on CloudTrail logs for detecting ConsoleLogin events.
   - Created a CloudWatch alarm triggered when login events occur.
   - Captured metric filter and alarm summary screenshots.

5. Athena Log Query Setup
   - Configured Athena query output location in S3.
   - Created a database and table for querying CloudTrail logs stored in S3.
   - Used Athena to run sample SQL queries to extract recent login events and API activity.
   - Collected screenshots of table creation and query results.
